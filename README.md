# DEMoS-italian-corpus-analysis

This repository contains the my 2 cents analysis of the DEMoS (Italian emotional speech corpus) database to better understand the ML Approach described in the research paper titled "DEMoS: An Italian emotional speech corpus: Elicitation methods, machine learning, and perception" by Parada-Cabaleiro, E., Costantini, G., Batliner, A., Schmitt, M., & Schuller, B. W.

## About the Database

The DEMoS database is a valuable resource for studying emotional speech in the Italian language. It provides researchers with a collection of annotated speech samples that can be used for various applications, such as emotion recognition, speech synthesis, and more. The database was created using specific elicitation methods and encompasses a wide range of emotional states.
